### Project Background
El Niño is a climate phenomenon characterized by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, influencing weather patterns worldwide and often causing droughts, floods, and other extreme conditions.

El Niño phenomenon will lead to reduced precipitation in many regions of Indonesia, with the extent of reduction depending on the location and intensity of the El Niño.

### Objectives
Analyzing the influence of El Niño on precipitation in Indonesia by taking a sample of a past El Niño event
